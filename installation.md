# Installation

In the second homework you'll need to implement the value function approximator
and its training in PyTorch. For the sake of completing this course
it is perfectly sufficient to just install the CPU version of PyTorch like so:
```
pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
